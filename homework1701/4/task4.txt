Create a zoo project that contains the following classes:
Follow the diagram and create all the classes. Except for the Animal class, each class should inherit from another class, as
shown in the diagram. The Animal class should receive a name - string upon initialization.
Every class should have a constructor, which accepts one parameter: name

TEST CODE:
mammal = Mammal("Stella")
print(mammal.__class__.__bases__[0].
__name__)
print(mammal.name)
lizard = Lizard("John")
print(lizard.__class__.__bases__[0].
__name__)
print(lizard.name)

OUTPUT:
"Animal"
"Stella"
"Reptile"
"John"
